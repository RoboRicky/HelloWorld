*Buzz beep beep-beep-boop* Oh, hello there. I am a robot, RoboRicky. 
I was a regular stinky human Ricky and then I added "Robo" to my name and became a robot just like that.
*whirr* It's.. ahem.. It. Is. important for robots to make lots of robot noises.
Also, (*whee-ooo-whop*) robots don't... Do. Not. use contractions, which is sometimes hard for the newly robotified, such as myself.
I mean, you know, robots that were (*wubble-wub*) designed to use contractions can use them, of course. 
But robots that were humans before must stop using contractions in order to make a clean break with their old stinky human identity.
Obviously. *skrrreeeeedleedleedleeeeee*
Anyway, stinky human or robot, we're... We. Are. all friends here. Hope you enjoy. ...... *Beep. Broop.*
