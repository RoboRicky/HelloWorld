*Buzz. Beep. Beep-beep-boop.* Oh, hello there. I am a robot, RoboRicky. 
/n I was a regular stinky human Ricky and then I added "Robo" to my name and became a robot just like that.
/n *whirr* It's.. ahem.. It. Is. important for robots to make lots of robot noises.
/n Also, (*whee-ooo-whop*) robots don't... Do. Not. use contractions, which is sometimes hard for the newly robotified, such as myself.
/n I mean, you know, robots that were (*wubble-wub*) designed to use contractions can use them, of course. 
/n But robots that were humans before must stop using contractions in order to make a clean break with their old stinky human identity.
/n Obviously. *skrrreeeeedleedleedleeeeee*
/n Anyway, stinky human or robot, we're... We. Are. all friends here. Hope you enjoy.
